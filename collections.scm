;;;;                Card Game Project - Collection Representation

#|
Collections are containers for cards that have some concept of
an order for them. The order does not necessarily need to be
used to access the collection's cards, but it allows collections
to be easily used for things like decks, discard piles, or
fields of "in-play" cards.

;;;     Collection Representation
#|  Collections mostly just need to keep track of a list
of the cards they currently contain.

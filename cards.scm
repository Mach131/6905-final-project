;;;;                Card Game Project - Card Representation

#|
Cards are essentially collections of various components, which
in turn are collections of fields that can be specified as
needed for a given type of card. Part of the power of components
is that by ensuring that the same "type" of component always
has the same field, assumptions can be made more effectively
about the types of things that can be done with that card.
|#

;;;     Card Representation
#|  The low-level representation for a card. Keeps track of
the associated components and their fields, maintaining the
invariant that every component identifier is unique. There
are records for components and fields to allow them to be
mutated without updating a card's entire component list.
